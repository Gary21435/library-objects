Simple reading list app.

Ideas to implement later:
- you can select a card with mouse and move it to another location; like app icons on ios
- decreasing size animation when a card is deleted
- add style to delete and edit buttons; fit more book cards on each row
- make custom images by having a black book image and overlaying inputted title and author name over it
